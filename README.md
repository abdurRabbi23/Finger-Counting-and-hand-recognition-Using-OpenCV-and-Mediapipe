# Finger-Counting-and-hand-recognition-Using-OpenCV-and-Mediapipe
Hi guys, I have just learn an easy yet interesting computer vision project which is to count fingers with the help of OpenCV and Mediapipe packages. Here the code is free and you can use it anywhere you wish. Thanks

To use this program you must install opencv, mediapipe and cvzone to your system. Please make sure to pre install these libraries and packages before you run the code.
